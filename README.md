CS50 is an outstanding resource which makes the fundementals of computer science available to everyone, for free.
Hats off to Harvard, EDX and everyone involved in putting it all together.
This repository is where I'm storing my personal progress on the course,
which I'm taking in 2019. In the spirit of academic honesty,
I would encourage you to not look if you're also taking the course or looking to enroll.
